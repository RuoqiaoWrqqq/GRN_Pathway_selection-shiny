An example of a Shiny web app using data frames, Sankey plots, networkD3, and visNetwork to visualize DE pathways/gene-sets [single-cell pathway score (scPS)](https://github.com/Thakar-Lab/scPS). results across different cell types and disease groups from the Reactome gene-set database.

To run the example from R use:

```S
shiny::runGitHub('RuoqiaoWrqqq/GRN_Pathway_selection-shiny')
